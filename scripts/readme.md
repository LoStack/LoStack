Some of these scripts were originally built with AI, some were written by hand, see scripts for details
All scripts audited to make sure they're not going to melt your system or pose a security risk.

These files aren't meant to look pretty or run as fast as possible (with the exception of fetch_bootstrap_icons). They just save considerable time downloading the files by hand. They pull JS and CSS from various CDNs to build and easily update LoStack's staticly served scripts, styles, and icons.

Run fetch_all.py to download all external CSS, JS, and image assets for LoStack
